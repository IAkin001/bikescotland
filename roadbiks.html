    <h1> What Are Road Bikes?</h1>
    <p1>Road bikes are designed for efficient and fast riding on paved surfaces, like smooth roads and bike paths. They typically have narrow, high-pressure tires and drop handlebars, placing the rider in a position that optimizes aerodynamics and speed. Road bikes come in various types, including race bikes, aero bikes, endurance bikes, and climbing bikes, each with specific features and geometries for different riding purposes</p1>
    <br>
    <p>Looking for an environmental friendly way of getting to work with European chic? Don’t want to buy lycra and a gel saddle? Then look no further than our replica Dutch road bikes. Suitable for all types of green commuters who don’t want to break the sound barrier our road bikes start at only £ 150.</p>
